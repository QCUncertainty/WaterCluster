# WaterCluster
This repo contains the codes and data of many-body expansion calculations on water clusters.

Notes on the files:
- scripts/batch_mbe_psi4.py: python script to batch run MBE calculations with Psi4.
- scripts/sub_geom-gen.py: python script to generate smaller clusters from larger clusters.
- scripts/random_water-gen.py: python script to generate water clusters with water molecules randomly positioned and oriented in a designated box.
- geoms/Wn_geoms_all.xyz (n = 3 - 10): stacked xyz files of n-water clusters (n = 3 - 10).- geoms/water.xyz: model water molecular coordinates for more water cluster geometries generation.
